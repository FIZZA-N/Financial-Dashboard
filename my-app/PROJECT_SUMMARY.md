## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm run server
```
Wait for: "Server running on port 5000" and "MongoDB connected"

### Step 5: Start Frontend (in new terminal)
```bash

```
Wait for: "Local: http://localhost:3000"

### Step 6: Access Application
1. Open http://localhost:3000
